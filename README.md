3. No, E2E would be better for something like this because unit testing would be used for testing smaller components. For testing a message feature it would also be important to test if an event happened and works. For example, if the message is sent when the user presses the enter key. Also with unit testing you would not know if the other user received the message or not.
4. Yes, because the message limit is defined and you can test a message less than the limit and a message that is over the limit.
